# Tennis Refactoring Kata Progress
This is my progress on Tennis refactoring kata by [@emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache).

Each step of refactoring is a single commit.

## Log
Original kata is here https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata. The repository contains only Objective-C code. I want to go with Swift code on the kata. I forked the original repo and made [Swift version of the kata's code](https://github.com/IvanRublev/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata).

We begin with TennisGame1. We refactor the code in small steps. We run tests after each step and fix the code if some test fail.
